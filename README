A Mesos development environment for Vagrant.

Made for Mesos developers like me, who use OSX but need to test stuff under
Linux from time to time. Your local Mesos source folder is mapped into the VM.
NFS is used for the mapping to get somewhat decent speed.
Uses Fedora 23, because it provides recent enough packages for almost all Mesos
features.

You'll need to provide the path to your local Mesos source dir in the
Vagrantfile, maybe change mem/cpu and configure flags, and you're good to go!
Vagrant provisioning will install all packages needed to compile Mesos and run
as many tests as possible. Mesos build dir will be in ~/build.

Needs the Vagrant Reload Provisioner, which can be installed with
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload
