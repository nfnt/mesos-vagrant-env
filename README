A Mesos development environment for Vagrant.

Made for Mesos developers like me, who use OSX but need to test stuff under
Linux from time to time. Uses Fedora 26, because it provides recent enough
packages for almost all Mesos features.

You'll maybe need to change mem/cpu and configure flags, and you're good to go!
Vagrant provisioning will install all packages needed to compile Mesos and run
as many tests as possible. Mesos build dir will be in ~/build.

Needs the Vagrant Reload Provisioner, which can be installed with
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload
